/**
 * Syncs the built plugin into the local WordPress Docker instance.
 *
 * The manual-QA site at http://localhost:8889 is the `wordpress-alcazaba`
 * docker-compose project. It bind-mounts its own checkout at /var/www, so
 * anything written into `<checkout>/src/wp-content/plugins/allterrain-forms` is
 * live in the container immediately -- no restart, no upload screen.
 *
 * A symlink would be tidier and does not work: the bind mount is the checkout
 * itself, so a link pointing at a sibling repository resolves to a path that
 * does not exist inside the container. Mirroring the files is what actually
 * reaches the site.
 *
 * Runs as part of `npm run build`, so every change reaches the site without a
 * separate step. When no WordPress checkout is present (CI, a fresh clone, a
 * different machine) it prints a note and exits successfully rather than failing
 * the build -- deploying is a convenience, not a build requirement.
 *
 * Override the destination with ATF_DEPLOY_TARGET, or skip entirely with
 * ATF_SKIP_DEPLOY=1.
